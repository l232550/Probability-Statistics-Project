Interactive Irrigation Data Dashboard (Probability & Statistics Project)

Overview:
This project is an interactive dashboard developed using R Shiny as part of the MT2005 Probability and Statistics course. It visualizes and analyzes irrigation data across Pakistan from 2015 to 2022, focusing on the area irrigated by different water sources such as canals, tubewells, and wells across various provinces.

Features:
- Interactive data table for filtering and sorting irrigation data by province and year
- Multiple visualization types including histograms, bar charts, boxplots, and pie charts
- Regression analysis tools (linear and multiple regression) to explore relationships in the data
- User-friendly interface built with `shinydashboard` and enhanced with `plotly` for interactive plots
- Data cleaning and transformation using `dplyr` and `tidyr`

DataSet Source:
The irrigation data is sourced from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics:  
[Area Irrigated by Different Sources (2015-2022)](https://www.pbs.gov.pk/sites/default/files/tables/agriculture_statistics/new/Area_Irrigated_by_Different_Sources.pdf)
